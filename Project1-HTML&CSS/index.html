National Geographic specials appeared on CBS beginning in 1965, later moving to ABC and then PBS. In 1963, NBC debuted Wild Kingdom, a popular program featuring zoologist Marlin Perkins as host. The BBC natural history unit in the UK was a similar pioneer, the first wildlife series LOOK presented by Sir Peter Scott, was a studio-based show, with filmed inserts. 
				
<P>It was in this series that David Attenborough first made his appearance which led to the series <a href="#">Zoo Quest</a> during which he and cameraman Charles Lagus went to many exotic places looking for elusive wildlifeï¿½notably the Komodo dragon in Indonesia and lemurs in Madagascar. 
				
<P>Since 1984, the Discovery Channel and its spin off Animal Planet in the USA have dominated the market for shows about wildlife on cable television, while on PBS the NATURE strand made by WNET-13 in New York and NOVA by WGBH in Boston are notable.</p>
