<h1>What To Write For The Link?</h1>

<h2>Couple Different Schools</h2>

<p>There are a couple different schools of thought on this. One suggests that what you write for links should be quite blatant. This includes text like "Click here for this" or "Here's a link to...".</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Follow a link..."
  <li>"Click here for this"</li>
  <li>"Here's a link to..."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hypertext</h2>

<p>The other states that since the hypertext links will be blue (or whatever color they're set to), the links should be just another word in the text set up as a link.</p>

<h2>Reality</h2>

<p>In reality it depends what you're doing. If you're building a menu bar down the side of your page (like those which appear on the left hand side of this page) then the last thing you want is for every single link to say "Click here for HTML Primer 1 - an introduction", simply because your menu would be as wide as your page...</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Menu</i>
  <li><i>Link</i>
  <li><i>Introduction</i>
</ol>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>For accessibility reasons you should try to make sure your links make sense out of context--diasbled people navigating your page can jump around hyperlinks using the "tab" key (there should be one on the left of your keyboard too). If they have skipped directly to your hyperlink which says "here" then they won't know what it's about.</p>

<h2>HTML Primer</h2>

<p>If they skip to one that says "HTML Primer: Introduction" then they should know whether or not they want to click.</p>
