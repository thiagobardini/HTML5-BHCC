    <h1>Achieving the Dream</h1>

<p>Achieving the Dream, Inc. is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to helping more community college students, particularly low-income students and students of color, stay in school and earn a college certificate or degree.</p>

<h1>BHCC</h1>
<p>Bunker Hill Community College was chosen in 2007 to participate in the national Achieving the Dream initiative. After three years, the College achieved “Leader College” status as one of only 66 community colleges nationwide. Leader Colleges demonstrate the power of the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement. To be eligible for Leader College distinction, colleges must show three or more years of improvement on one or more of these five measures:

    Course completion
    Advancement from developmental to credit-bearing courses
    Completion of college-level math and English courses
    Term-to-term and year-to-year retention
    Completion of certificates or degrees</p>

<h1>BHCC</h1>
<p>Bunker Hill Community College’s (BHCC) teaching and learning environment has been positively impacted by its student success initiatives, but most noticeably the college’s Learning Communities have been associated with enhancing success.

In 2012, BHCC was named as one of only four community colleges nationally to earn a Gates Foundation Catalyst Fund grant to expand its Learning Communities.

In 2014, BHCC received the Leah Meyer Austin Award for its success in increasing student retention and completion. Along with this prestigious recognition, BHCC received $25,000 to support its ongoing student success work. The award honored BHCC’s focus on college-wide, data-informed decision making that has resulted in measurable increases in critical areas. The college has:

    Increased fall-to-fall persistence from 41 percent to 51 percent
    Improved black students' completion rates from 68 percent to 72 percent
    Increased Latino students’ completion rates from 68 percent to 74 percent
    Raised completion rates in gateway English from 67 percent to 74 percent
    Improved completion rates in developmental English courses (reading and writing) from 72 percent to 78 percent</p>

<h1>BHCC</h1>
<p>BHCC attributed its impressive gains to strategies basic to Achieving the Dream’s Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement: committed leadership, use of evidence, broad engagement, systemic institutional improvement, and equity. BHCC embraced the Achieving the Dream model to meet the needs of specific student populations, with a particular focus on the highest-need students.

The Leah Meyer Austin Award, sponsored by The Leona M. & Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, was established in 2008 to recognize outstanding achievement in supporting and promoting student success through the creation of a culture of evidence, continuous improvement, systemic institutional change, broad engagement of stakeholders, and equity, with particular attention to low-income students and students of color.</p>
