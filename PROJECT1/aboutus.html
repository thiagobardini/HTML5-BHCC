<p><h2>About us</h2></p>

<p>This unit is based on the book Wild About Us by Karen Beaumont. Since the book is a celebration of individuality some of the activities focus on acceptance and tolerance of ourselves and others. Information skills are also included, as well as activities that could be used in a MakerSpace setting depending on available resources and time. Students will work in small groups to sort and classify pictures of zoo animals, discuss and defend their reasoning, reflect and adjust their work based on those reflections. They will be able to foster their own creativity by building their own special creatures and write about them. Finally, students will conduct research on real zoo animals. The research focus is using an online database, but the activity is flexible enough that print resources can be used as well. All of the activities enhance and build on the regular unit work and foundational story book.</p>
