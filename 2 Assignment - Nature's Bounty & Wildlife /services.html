<p>I know at least five Nigerians, including myself, who have had to throw large chunks of beef in the trash as we approached US customs officials. US border policies don’t allow the import of meat products from African countries because they may carry diseases. That’s fair.

However, it is perfectly legal to bring in trophy animals from Africa. They are the remains of animals hunted, primarily by Americans, for pleasure, or to prove “virility, prowess and dominance” as a report by the Humane Society International puts it.

In May, a Florida hunter gained approval to import the skin, skull, claws, and teeth of an African lion he killed in a game reserve in Tanzania. It’s the first known trophy lion to be allowed in the United States since 2016, when the Obama administration rightly placed a ban on trophy animal imports from some African countries, after lions and elephants were listed as “vulnerable’’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The US Endangered Species Act also lists them as endangered and threatened. </p>
